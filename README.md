Challenges and Solutions:

In the development of iHakeem, I encountered a significant challenge when I initially couldn't find the necessary SDKs for integrating hardware medical devices seamlessly.

This included integrating functionalities for weight measurement, Omron blood pressure monitoring, and blood sugar level tracking.
