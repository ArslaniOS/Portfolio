Challenges and Solutions:

In the development of iHakeem, I encountered a significant challenge when I initially couldn't find the necessary SDKs for integrating hardware medical devices seamlessly. Determined to provide users with a comprehensive healthcare experience, I embarked on a self-study journey into Bluetooth Core Low Energy (BLE) and High Energy (Classic).

Upon thorough exploration of the Bluetooth manuals and understanding the intricacies of native UUIDs, I successfully devised a solution to connect iHakeem with essential medical devices. This included integrating functionalities for weight measurement, Omron blood pressure monitoring, and blood sugar level tracking.

This proactive approach not only showcased my commitment to overcoming obstacles but also enriched iHakeem's capabilities, allowing users to seamlessly incorporate vital health data into their comprehensive healthcare journey. This endeavor reflects my dedication to achieving technical excellence and delivering a holistic healthcare solution to users.
