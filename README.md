# iHakeem
iHakeem is an online advanced Healthcare platform that takes your healthcare experience to another level by connecting you with all Healthcare Providers in the medical sector in the comfort of your home or outdoors where you may need immediate or urgent consultation.
I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. I'm particularly proud of the app's animation, UI design, and easily-extended architecture. iHakeem was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5; it utilizes Auto Layout for UI design, and makes extensive use of both UIView animations and CAEmitterLayers.
